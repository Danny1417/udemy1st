            <p> The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of
                  wild
                  species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia.
                  Rooster or
                  cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has
                  been
                  castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a
                  pullet. Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs)
                  and as
                  pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. The
                  chicken domesticated for its meat are Broilers and for its eggs are Layers</p>

                        According to Merriam-Webster, the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird) originated in the mid- or
                        late 18th century as a
                        euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[22][23][24] and is
                        widely used throughout North
                        America. Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[25]

            <p> Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7
                  billion
                  as of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any
                  other
                  bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in myth, folklore and religion, and in
                  language and
                  literature.[citation needed]</p>
            <p> Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia,
                  and
                  East Asia,[3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from
                  the
                  Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear
                  in
                  Egypt in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land
                  between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known
                  in
                  Greece from the 5th century BC.[7][8] </p>
